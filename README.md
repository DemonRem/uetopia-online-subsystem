# uetopia-online-subsystem
Online Subsystem plugin for Unreal Engine 4

This branch is for the stock 4.20 engine.

THIS BRANCH HAS ONLY HAD MINOR TESTING.  IF you find bugs or problems, get in touch.

It does not include the custom OSS changes for Matchmaker, Tournaments, and Chat channel delegates.

If you want to use matchmaker, tournaments, or push chat channels, use the regular 4.20 branch, and patched 4.20 engine.
