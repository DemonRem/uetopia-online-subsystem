# uetopia-online-subsystem
Online Subsystem plugin for Unreal Engine 4

4.17 Branch requires some engine patches, until the pull request is approved.  Fixes for "loginFLow" and "missing libcef.so" as well as OSS support for tournaments, and some extra delegates.

You can use a pre-patched 4.17 engine here:
